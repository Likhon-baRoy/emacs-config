#+TITLE: My org more config
#+AUTHOR: Nick George

This has been updated to use the normal emacs =init.el= file which loads a file (byte-compiled) called =revised-init.el= to initialize. I previously organized my init file as an =org-mode= document then tangled and loaded it, but my emacs startup times were very slow. My current method is much faster. The =config.org= file is here only as a record.

* Nick's Emacs config

I started using emacs when I started learning Clojure using Daniel Higginbotham's book [[http://www.braveclojure.com/][Clojure for the brave and true]].

My config is located in =init.el= which then loads =revised-init.el=.
